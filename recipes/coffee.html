    <h3>Description</h3>
    Coffee is a brewed drink prepared from roasted coffee beans, <br> 
    the seeds of berries from certain flowering plants in the Coffea genus. <br>   
    From the coffee fruit, the seeds are separated to produce a stable, <br> 
    raw product: unroasted green coffee. <br> 
    The seeds are then roasted, a process which transforms them into a consumable product: roasted coffee, <br> 
    which is ground into fine particles that are typically steeped in hot water before being filtered out, producing a cup of coffee.
    <br>
